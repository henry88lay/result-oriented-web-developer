	<p align="center">Most <strong>lemonade</strong> varieties can be separated into two distinct types: cloudy or clear; each is known simply as "lemonade" (or a cognate) in countries where dominant.[2]

	<br>Cloudy lemonade, generally found in North America and South Asia, is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar or honey.[3] In the United Kingdom and Australia, clear lemonade, which is typically also carbonated, dominates.[2]</p>

	<p align="right">A popular cloudy variation is pink lemonade, made with added fruit flavors such as raspberry or strawberry giving the drink its distinctive pink color.[4]
	The suffix "-ade" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade, orangeade, or cherryade.[5]
	Alcoholic varieties are known as hard lemonade. <p>

	<p align="justify">In some countries, the name <em>"lemonade"</em> is also used for other, non-lemon flavored drinks (carbonated or not), such as the German "Orangenlimonade".[6] Although considered a common restaurant drink, lemonade is not considered a "staple".</p>
